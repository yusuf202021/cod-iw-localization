# cod-iw-localization
A tool for unofficial localization project for Call of Duty - Infinite Warfare


Current localize.json doesn't contain all strings. You should dump it yourself.


Tested on Fitgirl version (Call.of.Duty.Infinite.Warfare-RELOADED)


Usage:


        -e: It dumps localize.json from memory
  
  
        -i: It loads localize.json to memory
