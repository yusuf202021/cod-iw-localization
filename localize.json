For the past year, the traumatizing experience seems to have no effect on his combat readiness or mental sharpness.\n\nIf anything, I would say the experience has given him purpose.  He seems more focused than ever.  Calm.  It's really quite inspiring, actually.  Most soldiers I've come across have \"dead\" eyes - they just look right through me, as if I'm not even there.\n\nCaptain Rorke displays no medical hindrances, physical or mental.  \n\nDiagnosis:  Combat Ready.",

Even surrender my very life in service to your country.\n\nBut I am not one of you. The \"Just\" have turned their backs and become deaf to your cries.  Who, then, will show them justice?  Who will show you the Liberty they have promised?  The weapon they have created will be their undoing.\n\nBut do not fear this.  Do not fear me.  It is only natural.  Like the collapse of Rome, your cities will crumble and there will be great sorrow.  But from the ashes of this diseased metropolis, a rebirth will occur.  It will be paid for with blood and steel. Liberty must be restored. I am Gabriel Rorke, and I am here to show you the true meaning of justice.",

    "platform_eula_6": "16.\tFor residents in North America-- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:\n\nREAD THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n\nThese BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.\n\nInitial Dispute Resolution:  Activision's Customer Support department is available by phone ((310) 255-2050) or on the web (https://support.activision.com/) to address any concerns you may have regarding the Program. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.\n\nBinding Arbitration:  If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Program shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the \"FAA\") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. \n\nThe JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Activision will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n\nLocation:  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n \nClass Action Waiver:  The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\nException - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Program under this Agreement. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\n\n30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the \"Binding Arbitration,\" \"Location,\" and \"Class Action Waiver\" paragraphs above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405-3032, Attn: Legal. The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Program (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Program and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Activision also will not be bound by them. \n\nChanges to this Section:  Activision will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.",

    "platform_eula_8": "19.\tSUPPLEMENTAL TERMS– GERMANY\n\nThe following Sections below supersede and replace the corresponding Sections above for residents in Germany:\n \nModification of Terms: From time to time, Activision may need to amend this Agreement, for example to reflect or include new products or services, to enhance security for users or because of changes in the law. If Activision makes such a change to this Agreement we will inform you of the particular changes in advance no later than thirty (30) calendar days before such changes come into force and you shall be deemed to have accepted these changes (i) unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within thirty (30) calendar days from the moment of receipt of notification from us, or (ii) if you use the Program after the changes have entered into force. In the notification, we will inform you of your right to object, of the applicable notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object.\n\nThe latest version of this Agreement will always be available on our website, so we recommend that you check for updates to this Agreement each time you use the Program. Changes to the Agreement shall not affect your accrued rights, shall not substantially disrupt the contractual balance between you and us under this Agreement and shall not have retroactive effect.\n\nService Provided Content: In addition to the above, the following Right of Withdrawal shall apply to German residents.\n\nIf you are a consumer (i.e. a natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that predominantly are outside his trade, business or profession), then you shall have a right of withdrawal as set out hereafter.\n\nInformation concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal\n\nRight of Withdrawal\n\nYou have the right to withdraw from any Purchase Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day of the conclusion of the Purchase Contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (Cooperatie Activision Blizzard International UA of Beechavenue 131, 1119RB Schiphol-Rijk, Netherlands contact details available at www.support.activision.com) of your decision to withdraw from a Purchase Contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the model withdrawal form attached hereafter, but it is not obligatory. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.\n\nEffects of withdrawal\n\nIf you withdraw from the Purchase Contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this Purchase Contract, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this Purchase Contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.\n\nIf you requested to begin the performance of services under a Purchase Contract during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from that Purchase Contract, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Purchase Contract.\n\nEnd of the information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal\n\nYou lose your right of withdrawal, insofar as the Purchase Contract is a service contract, after the service has been fully performed and if the performance has begun with your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the service has been fully performed by us.\n\nYou lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Purchase Contract comprises the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.\n\nBased on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Service Provided Content, you consent that we make available these Service Provided Content to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Service Provided Content have been made fully available to you by us. However, your right of withdrawal is not lost if you purchase Virtual Goods that are granted to you for a certain period of time (e.g. time-limited premium memberships). \n****\n\nModel withdrawal Form\n\nPlease complete and return this withdrawal form if you wish to withdraw from a contract with us.\n\n-\tTo: [Cooperatie Activision Blizzard International UA of Beechavenue 131, 1119RB Schiphol-Rijk, Netherlands, \n-\tI/We hereby give notice that I/We withdraw from my/our contract for the purchase of the following goods/ the provision of the following services:*\n-\tOrdered/ received on*:\n-\tName of consumer(s):\t\n-\tAddress of consumer(s):\n-\tSignature of consumer(s): (only required if this form is notified on paper)\n-\tDate: \n\n(*) Delete where appropriate.",
